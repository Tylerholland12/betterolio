        <h2>üêÖ Life Of Ti</h2>
        <p>
          Tyler is originally from Auburn, AL where he explored many different subjects and leanrned many life skills. He soon took a fond liking to engineering design where he was able to re-create the house in the famous Pixar movie "UP" by using autoCAD. 
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, Tyler was able to discover more and more softwares of different variety and he soon found himself falling in love with the software itself and became highly fascinated in the essence of code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tyler soon began to explore the internet for ways to incorparate code to practical use. He then found a computer programming language by the name of Python that seemed impossible to learn and that seemed far out of his reach, but he dove right in and began to explore the depths of which he did not know. He kept digging and digging and digging until he could understand the basic contruct that Python is. Even when he didn't think that there was more to learn on his own, he kept going and going, determined to not give up or let up his understanding of what would soon be the first language would fall in love with.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
            Some of the more interesting projects that I have been able to create are CryptoDapp(Javascript, Truffle Framework, HTML, CSS, Solidity, Web3.js, Makefile, Metamask, and Ganache), Trackit(React.js, HTML, and CSS, Speechly), SCDL(Golang). 
            CryptoDapp is one of my more notable and one of my favorite projects that I have worked on because I was able to create an advanced DApp with all of my learned knowledge.  I was able to complete this project in about a week's time and I was able to develop the frontend and the backend for this project. The tricky thing about this project though was trying to figure out the best way to convert Wei into ETH. Thankfully I was able to learn some things from everyone that I asked around me and those who I may not have known so well. I was able to ask a lot of questions to learn as much as I could about some of the technologies that I either haven‚Äôt used in a while or about some of the minor details of some of the tools. CryptoDapp is essentially a way for two people to swap tokens of a different variety with one another that utilizes a decentralized approach which means that you do not have to go through a third party or through another means to receive the funds that you are requesting from that other person.
            Trackit is another project that I worked on that I really enjoyed! I was able to create a budgeting system that was user-friendly and that people could use with ease. I was able to learn how to utilize voice recognition so that users could have a smooth interaction with the application if they did not want to have to type everything out. A large majority of the frontend and logic was built with React.js so that it would have a nice and simple interface for the users to interact with and I was able to use a little bit of HTML and CSS for some of the more minor details that were utilized throughout the project. Trackit was a fun project for me because it‚Äôs something that I can use myself to the point where I can have fun using it to save my own budgeting strategies in my day-to-day life. 
            SCDL was a duo project that I worked on with one of my friends and we primarily used Golang for the development of this project. I really loved this project because we were able to use Soundcloud and their API to externally download their music with a simple search on your personal laptop or computer. This project allows you to type in a command and it will automatically download the song that you chose as an mp3 file that you can listen to at any time you want. My favorite part about this project was trying to figure out how to make sure that each song was a song itself and to make sure that each song was a song from Soundcloud and not from Spotify or from YouTube. What I was able to do was I found out that some of the tags that are used under the surface only match that of Soundcloud and I was able to match these tags with what I knew would only be relevant to the types of songs that we would want people to listen to or what we thought people would like.
